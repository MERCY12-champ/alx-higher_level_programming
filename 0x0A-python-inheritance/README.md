Inheritance is a way to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. The new class is called the derived class, and the existing class is the base class. The derived class inherits attributes and behaviors from the base class, and you can use those attributes and behaviors in the derived class as if they were defined in the derived class. You can also override or extend the attributes and behaviors inherited from the base class.
