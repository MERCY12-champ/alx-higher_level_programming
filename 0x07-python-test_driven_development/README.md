Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach in which tests are written for a new feature or piece of code before the actual code is written. The goal of TDD is to ensure that the code meets the requirements and works as expected.

The basic process of TDD is as follows:

Write a test: The first step in TDD is to write a test for the feature or code you want to implement. This test should define the expected behavior of the code and specify how it should be used.

Run the test: The next step is to run the test. At this point, the test should fail because the code has not been written yet.

Write the code: The third step is to write the code that will make the test pass. The goal is to write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass.

Run the tests again: Once the code has been written, the tests should be run again to verify that the code works as expected.

Refactor the code: If the tests pass, the code can be refactored (i.e., cleaned up and optimized) to improve its quality.
